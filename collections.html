                                        The Malazan Empire simmers with discontent, bled dry by interminable warfare, bitter infighting and bloody confrontations with the formidable Anomander Rake 
                                        and his Tiste Andii, ancient and implacable sorcerers. Even the imperial legions, long inured to the bloodshed, yearn for some respite. 
                                        Yet Empress Laseen's rule remains absolute, enforced by her dread Claw assassins.
                                        
                                        <br><br>For Sergeant Whiskeyjack and his squad of Bridgeburners, and for Tattersail, surviving cadre mage of the Second Legion, the aftermath 
                                        of the siege of Pale should have been a time to mourn the many dead. But Darujhistan, last of the Free Cities of Genabackis, yet holds out. 
                                        It is to this ancient citadel that Laseen turns her predatory gaze.
                                        
                                        <br><br>However, it would appear that the Empire is not alone in this great game. Sinister, shadowbound forces are gathering as the gods

                                        Empire in one of the bloodiest conflicts it has ever known, shaping destinies and giving birth to legends.

                                        In Northern Genabackis, a raiding party of savage tribal warriors descends from the mountains into the southern flatlands. 
                                        Their intention is to wreak havoc amongst the despised lowlanders, but for the one named Karsa Orlong it marks the beginning of what 
                                        will prove to be an extraordinary destiny.
                                        
                                        <br><br>Some years later, it is the aftermath of the Chain of Dogs. Tavore, the Adjunct to the Empress, has arrived in the last 
                                        remaining Malazan stronghold of Seven Cities. New to command, she must hone twelve thousand soldiers, mostly raw recruits but for a 
                                        handful of veterans of Coltaine's legendary march, into a force capable of challenging the massed hordes of Sha'ik's Whirlwind who lie 
                                        in wait in the heart of the Holy Desert.
                                        <br>But waiting is never easy. The seer's warlords are locked into a power struggle that threatens the very soul of the rebellion, 
                                        while Sha'ik herself suffers, haunted by the knowledge of her nemesis: her own sister, Tavore.

                                        But the price of peace is a pact with a hidden power whose motives may be deadly. To the south, the expansionist kingdom of Lether 
                                        has devoured all lesser neighbors - except the Tiste Edur.

                                        The Seven Cities Rebellion has been crushed. Sha'ik is dead. One last rebel force remains, holed up in the city of Y'Ghatan and under the 
                                        fanatical command of Leoman of the Flails. The prospect of laying siege to this ancient fortress makes the battle-weary Malaz 14th Army uneasy. 
                                        <br>For it was here that the Empire's greatest champion Dassem Ultor was slain and a tide of Malazan blood spilled. 
                                        A place of foreboding, its smell is of death. But elsewhere, agents of a far greater conflict have made their opening moves. 
                                        
                                        <br><br>The Crippled God has been granted a place in the pantheon, a schism threatens and sides must be chosen. Whatever each god decides, 
                                        the ground-rules have changed, irrevocably, terrifyingly and the first blood spilled will be in the mortal world. 
                                        
                                        <br><br>A world in which a host of characters, familiar and new, including Heboric Ghost Hands, the possessed Apsalar, Cutter, once a thief now a 
                                        killer, the warrior Karsa Orlong and the two ancient wanderers Icarium and Mappo, each searching for such a fate as they might 
                                        fashion with their own hands, guided by their own will. If only the gods would leave them alone. 
                                        
                                        <br><br>But now that knives have been unsheathed, the gods are disinclined to be kind. There shall be war, war in the heavens.
                                        And the prize? Nothing less than existence itself...

                                        All is not well in the Letherii Empire. 
                                        Rhulad Sengar, the Emperor of a Thousand Deaths, spirals into madness, surrounded by sycophants and agents of his Machiavellian chancellor, 
                                        while the Letherii secret police conduct a campaign of terror against its own people. The Errant, once a farseeing god, is 
                                        suddenly blind to the future. Conspiracies seethe throughout the palace, as the empire - driven by the corrupt and self-interested - 
                                        edges ever-closer to all-out war with the neighbouring kingdoms. 
                                        
                                        <br><br>And the great Edur fleet - its warriors selected from countless peoples - draws ever closer. 
                                        Amongst them are Karsa Orlong and Icarium Lifestealer - each destined to cross blades with the emperor himself. 
                                        That yet more blood is to be spilled is inevitable... 
                                        
                                        <br><br>Against this backdrop, a band of fugitives seek a way out of the empire, 
                                        but one of them, Fear Sengar must find the soul of Scabandari Bloodeye. It is his hope that it might help halt the Tiste Edur, 
                                        and so save his brother, the emperor. Yet, travelling with them is Scabandari's most ancient foe: Silchas Ruin, brother of Anomander Rake. 
                                        And his motives are anything but certain - for the wounds he carries on his back, made by the blades of Scabandari, are still fresh. 
                                        
                                        <br><br>Fate decrees that there is to be a reckoning, for such bloodshed cannot go unanswered - and it will be a reckoning on an 
                                        unimaginable scale...

                                        In Darujhistan, the city of blue fire, it is said that love and death shall arrive dancing. It is summer and the heat is oppressive, 
                                        ut for the small round man in the faded red waistcoat, discomfiture is not just because of the sun. All is not well. 
                                        Dire portents plague his nights and haunt the city streets like fiends of shadow. Assassins skulk in alleyways, but the quarry has 
                                        turned and the hunters become the hunted. Hidden hands pluck the strings of tyranny like a fell chorus. 
                                        While the bards sing their tragic tales, somewhere in the distance can be heard the baying of Hounds...
                                        
                                        <br><br>And in the distant city of Black Coral, where rules Anomander Rake, Son of Darkness, ancient crimes awaken, intent on revenge. 
                                        It seems Love and Death are indeed about to arrive...hand in hand, dancing.

                                        In Letherii, the exiled Malazan army commanded by Adjunct Tavore begins its march into the eastern Wastelands, to fight for an unknown 
                                        cause against an enemy it has never seen.

                                        <br><br>And in these same Wastelands, others gather to confront their destinies. 
                                        <br>The warlike Barghast, thwarted in their vengeance against the Tiste Edur, seek new enemies beyond the border and Onos Toolan, 
                                        once immortal T'lan Imass now mortal commander of the White Face clan, faces insurrection. To the south, the Perish Grey Helms parlay 
                                        passage through the treacherous kingdom of Bolkando. 
                                        
                                        <br><br>Their intention is to rendezvous with the Bonehunters but their vow of allegiance to the Malazans will be sorely tested. 
                                        And ancient enclaves of an Elder Race are in search of salvation--not among their own kind, but among humans--as an old enemy draws 
                                        ever closer to the last surviving bastion of the K'Chain Che'Malle.

                                        <br><br>So this last great army of the Malazan Empire is resolved to make one final defiant, heroic stand in the name of redemption. 
                                        <br>But can deeds be heroic when there is no one to witness them? And can that which is not witnessed forever change the world? 
                                        Destines are rarely simple, truths never clear but one certainty is that time is on no one's side. 
                                        <br>For the Deck of Dragons has been read, unleashing a dread power that none can comprehend…

                                        The Bonehunters march for Kolanse, led by Adjunct Tavore. This woman with no gifts of magic, deemed plain, unprepossessing, 
                                        displaying nothing to instill loyalty or confidence, will challenge the gods - if her own mutinous troops don't kill her first.

                                        <br><br>Her enemy, the Forkrul Assail, seek to cleanse the world, to annihilate everything. In the realm of Kurald Galain, 
                                        home to the long lost city of Kharkanas, a refugees commanded by Yedan Derryg, the Watch, await the breaching of Lightfall, 
                                        and the coming of the Tiste Liosan. In this war they cannot win, they will die in the name of an empty city and a queen with no subjects.

                                        <br><br>Elsewhere, the three Elder Gods, Kilmandaros, Errastas and Sechul Lath, work to shatter the chains binding Korabas, the Otataral Dragon. 
                                        Against her force of utter devastation, no mortal can stand. At the Gates of Starvald Demelain, the Azath House sealing the portal is dying. 
                                        <br>Soon will come the Eleint, dragons, and a final cataclysm.
