                                        The Malazan Empire simmers with discontent, bled dry by interminable warfare, bitter infighting and bloody confrontations with the formidable Anomander Rake 
                                        and his Tiste Andii, ancient and implacable sorcerers. Even the imperial legions, long inured to the bloodshed, yearn for some respite. 
                                        Yet Empress Laseen's rule remains absolute, enforced by her dread Claw assassins.

                                        of the siege of Pale should have been a time to mourn the many dead. But Darujhistan, last of the Free Cities of Genabackis, yet holds out. 
                                        It is to this ancient citadel that Laseen turns her predatory gaze.
                                        
                                        <br><br>However, it would appear that the Empire is not alone in this great game. Sinister, shadowbound forces are gathering as the gods

                                        In Northern Genabackis, a raiding party of savage tribal warriors descends from the mountains into the southern flatlands. 
                                        Their intention is to wreak havoc amongst the despised lowlanders, but for the one named Karsa Orlong it marks the beginning of what 
                                        will prove to be an extraordinary destiny.
                                        
                                        <br><br>Some years later, it is the aftermath of the Chain of Dogs. Tavore, the Adjunct to the Empress, has arrived in the last 
                                        remaining Malazan stronghold of Seven Cities. New to command, she must hone twelve thousand soldiers, mostly raw recruits but for a 
                                        handful of veterans of Coltaine's legendary march, into a force capable of challenging the massed hordes of Sha'ik's Whirlwind who lie 
                                        in wait in the heart of the Holy Desert.
                                        <br>But waiting is never easy. The seer's warlords are locked into a power struggle that threatens the very soul of the rebellion, 
                                        while Sha'ik herself suffers, haunted by the knowledge of her nemesis: her own sister, Tavore.

                                        But the price of peace is a pact with a hidden power whose motives may be deadly. To the south, the expansionist kingdom of Lether 
                                        has devoured all lesser neighbors - except the Tiste Edur.

                                        The Seven Cities Rebellion has been crushed. Sha'ik is dead. One last rebel force remains, holed up in the city of Y'Ghatan and under the 
                                        fanatical command of Leoman of the Flails. The prospect of laying siege to this ancient fortress makes the battle-weary Malaz 14th Army uneasy. 
                                        <br>For it was here that the Empire's greatest champion Dassem Ultor was slain and a tide of Malazan blood spilled. 
                                        A place of foreboding, its smell is of death. But elsewhere, agents of a far greater conflict have made their opening moves. 
                                        
                                        <br><br>The Crippled God has been granted a place in the pantheon, a schism threatens and sides must be chosen. Whatever each god decides, 
                                        the ground-rules have changed, irrevocably, terrifyingly and the first blood spilled will be in the mortal world. 
                                        
                                        <br><br>A world in which a host of characters, familiar and new, including Heboric Ghost Hands, the possessed Apsalar, Cutter, once a thief now a 
                                        killer, the warrior Karsa Orlong and the two ancient wanderers Icarium and Mappo, each searching for such a fate as they might 
                                        fashion with their own hands, guided by their own will. If only the gods would leave them alone. 
                                        
                                        <br><br>But now that knives have been unsheathed, the gods are disinclined to be kind. There shall be war, war in the heavens.
                                        And the prize? Nothing less than existence itself...

                                        All is not well in the Letherii Empire. 
                                        Rhulad Sengar, the Emperor of a Thousand Deaths, spirals into madness, surrounded by sycophants and agents of his Machiavellian chancellor, 
                                        while the Letherii secret police conduct a campaign of terror against its own people. The Errant, once a farseeing god, is 
                                        suddenly blind to the future. Conspiracies seethe throughout the palace, as the empire - driven by the corrupt and self-interested - 
                                        edges ever-closer to all-out war with the neighbouring kingdoms. 
                                        
                                        <br><br>And the great Edur fleet - its warriors selected from countless peoples - draws ever closer. 
                                        Amongst them are Karsa Orlong and Icarium Lifestealer - each destined to cross blades with the emperor himself. 
                                        That yet more blood is to be spilled is inevitable... 
                                        
                                        <br><br>Against this backdrop, a band of fugitives seek a way out of the empire, 
                                        but one of them, Fear Sengar must find the soul of Scabandari Bloodeye. It is his hope that it might help halt the Tiste Edur, 
                                        and so save his brother, the emperor. Yet, travelling with them is Scabandari's most ancient foe: Silchas Ruin, brother of Anomander Rake. 
                                        And his motives are anything but certain - for the wounds he carries on his back, made by the blades of Scabandari, are still fresh. 
                                        
                                        <br><br>Fate decrees that there is to be a reckoning, for such bloodshed cannot go unanswered - and it will be a reckoning on an 
                                        unimaginable scale...

                                        In Darujhistan, the city of blue fire, it is said that love and death shall arrive dancing. It is summer and the heat is oppressive, 
                                        ut for the small round man in the faded red waistcoat, discomfiture is not just because of the sun. All is not well. 
                                        Dire portents plague his nights and haunt the city streets like fiends of shadow. Assassins skulk in alleyways, but the quarry has 
                                        turned and the hunters become the hunted. Hidden hands pluck the strings of tyranny like a fell chorus. 
                                        While the bards sing their tragic tales, somewhere in the distance can be heard the baying of Hounds...
                                        
                                        <br><br>And in the distant city of Black Coral, where rules Anomander Rake, Son of Darkness, ancient crimes awaken, intent on revenge. 
                                        It seems Love and Death are indeed about to arrive...hand in hand, dancing.

                                        In Letherii, the exiled Malazan army commanded by Adjunct Tavore begins its march into the eastern Wastelands, to fight for an unknown 
                                        cause against an enemy it has never seen.

                                        <br><br>And in these same Wastelands, others gather to confront their destinies. 
                                        <br>The warlike Barghast, thwarted in their vengeance against the Tiste Edur, seek new enemies beyond the border and Onos Toolan, 
                                        once immortal T'lan Imass now mortal commander of the White Face clan, faces insurrection. To the south, the Perish Grey Helms parlay 
                                        passage through the treacherous kingdom of Bolkando. 
                                        
                                        <br><br>Their intention is to rendezvous with the Bonehunters but their vow of allegiance to the Malazans will be sorely tested. 
                                        And ancient enclaves of an Elder Race are in search of salvation--not among their own kind, but among humans--as an old enemy draws 
                                        ever closer to the last surviving bastion of the K'Chain Che'Malle.

                                        <br><br>So this last great army of the Malazan Empire is resolved to make one final defiant, heroic stand in the name of redemption. 
                                        <br>But can deeds be heroic when there is no one to witness them? And can that which is not witnessed forever change the world? 
                                        Destines are rarely simple, truths never clear but one certainty is that time is on no one's side. 
                                        <br>For the Deck of Dragons has been read, unleashing a dread power that none can comprehendâ€¦

                                        The Bonehunters march for Kolanse, led by Adjunct Tavore. This woman with no gifts of magic, deemed plain, unprepossessing, 
                                        displaying nothing to instill loyalty or confidence, will challenge the gods - if her own mutinous troops don't kill her first.

                                        <br><br>Her enemy, the Forkrul Assail, seek to cleanse the world, to annihilate everything. In the realm of Kurald Galain, 
                                        home to the long lost city of Kharkanas, a refugees commanded by Yedan Derryg, the Watch, await the breaching of Lightfall, 
                                        and the coming of the Tiste Liosan. In this war they cannot win, they will die in the name of an empty city and a queen with no subjects.

                                        <br><br>Elsewhere, the three Elder Gods, Kilmandaros, Errastas and Sechul Lath, work to shatter the chains binding Korabas, the Otataral Dragon. 
                                        Against her force of utter devastation, no mortal can stand. At the Gates of Starvald Demelain, the Azath House sealing the portal is dying.

                                        Greymane believed he'd outrun his past. With his school for swordsmanship in Falar, he was looking forward to a quiet life, 
                                        although his colleague Kyle wasn't as enamoured with things outside the mercenary company, the Crimson Guard.
                                        
                                        <br><br>However, it seems it is not so easy for an ex-Fist of the Malazan Empire to disappear, especially one under sentence of death 
                                        from that same Empire. For there is a new Emperor on the throne of Malaz, and he is dwelling on the ignominy that is the Empire's 
                                        failed invasion of the Korel subcontinent. In the vaults beneath Unta, the Imperial capital, lie the answers to that disaster. 
                                        And out of this buried history surfaces the name Stonewielder.
                                        
                                        <br><br>In Korel, Lord Protector Hiam, commander of the Stormguard, faces the potential annihilation of all that he holds dear. 
                                        With few remaining men and a crumbling stone wall that has seen better days, he confronts an ancient enemy: 
                                        the sea-borne Stormriders have returned. 
                                        
                                        <br><br>Religious war also threatens these lands. The cult of the Blessed Lady, which had stood firm against the Riders for millennia, 
                                        now seeks to eradicate its rivals. And as chaos looms, a local magistrate investigating a series of murders suddenly finds himself 
                                        at the heart of a far more ancient and terrifying crime -- one that has tainted an entire land.

                                        Darujhistan, city of dreams, city of blue flames, is peaceful at last; its citizens free to return to politicking, bickering, 
                                        trading and, above all, enjoying the good things in life. Yet there are those who will not allow the past to remain buried. 
                                        <br>A scholar digging in the plains stumbles across an ancient sealed vault. The merchant Humble Measure schemes to drive out the 
                                        remaining Malazan invaders. And the surviving agents of a long-lost power are stirring, for they sense change and so, opportunity. 
                                        <br>While, as ever at the centre of everything, a thief in a red waistcoat and of rotund proportions walks the streets, 
                                        juggling in one hand custard pastries, and in the other the fate of the city itself.
 
                                        <br><br>Far to the south, fragments of the titanic Moon's Spawn have crashed into the Rivan Sea creating a series of isles... and a 
                                        fortune hunter's dream. A Malazan veteran calling himself 'Red' ventures out to try his luck -- and perhaps say goodbye to old friends. 
                                        But there he finds far more than he'd bargained for as the rush to claim the Spawn's treasures descends into a mad scramble of chaos 
                                        and bloodshed. For powers from across the world have gathered here, searching for the legendary Throne of Night. 
                                        The impact of these events are far reaching, it seems. On an unremarkable island off the coast of Genabackis, a people who had 
                                        turned their backs upon all such strivings now lift their masked faces towards the mainland and recall the ancient prophesy of a return.
                                         
                                        <br><br>And what about the ex-Claw of the Malazan Empire who now walks the uttermost edge of creation? 
                                        <br>His mission -- the success or failure of which the Queen of Dreams saw long ago -- is destined to shape far more 
                                        than anyone could have ever imagined.

                                        In the western sky the bright emerald banner of the Visitor descends like a portent of annihilation. 
                                        
                                        <br><br>On the continent of Jacuruku, the Thaumaturgs have mounted yet another expedition to tame the neighboring wild jungle. 
                                        Yet this is no normal wilderness. It is called Himatan, and it is said to be half of the spirit-realm and half of the earth. 
                                        And it is said to be ruled by a powerful entity whom some name the Queen of Witches, and some a goddess: the ancient Ardata. 
                                        Saeng grew up knowing only the rule of the magus Thaumaturgs -- but it was the voices out of that land's forgotten past that she listened to. 
                                        And when her rulers mount an invasion of the neighboring jungle, those voices send her and her brother on a desperate mission.
 
                                        <br><br>To the south, the desert tribes are united by the arrival of a foreign warleader, a veteran commander in battered ashen mail whom 
                                        his men call, the Grey Ghost. This warleader takes the tribes on a raid like none other, deep into the heart of Thaumaturg lands. 
                                        While word comes to K'azz, and mercenary company the Crimson Guard, of a contract in Jacuruku. And their employer... none other than Ardata 
                                        herself.

                                        Tens of thousands of years of ice is melting, and the land of Assail, long a byword for menace and inaccessibility, is at last yielding 
                                        its secrets. Tales of gold discovered in the region's north circulate in every waterfront dive and sailor's tavern, and now countless 
                                        adventurers and fortune-seekers have set sail in search of riches. 
                                        <br>All these adventurers have to guide them are legends and garbled tales of the dangers that lie in wait -- hostile coasts, 
                                        fields of ice, impassable barriers and strange, terrifying creatures. But all accounts concur that the people of the north meet all 
                                        trespassers with the sword. And beyond are rumoured to lurk Elder monsters out of history's very beginnings.

                                        <br><br>Into this turmoil ventures the mercenary company, the Crimson Guard. Not drawn by contract, but by the promise of answers: 
                                        answers to mysteries that Shimmer, second in command, wonders should even be sought. Arriving also, part of an uneasy alliance of 
                                        Malazan fortune-hunters and Letherii soldiery, comes the bard Fisher kel Tath. And with him is a Tiste Andii who was found washed 
                                        ashore and cannot remember his past life, yet who commands far more power than he really should. Also venturing north is said to be a 
                                        mighty champion, a man who once fought for the Malazans, the bearer of a sword that slays gods: Whiteblade.
                                        
                                        <br><br>And lastly, far to the south, a woman guards the shore awaiting both her allies and her enemies. 
                                        <br>Silverfox, newly incarnated Summoner of the undying army of the T'lan Imass, will do anything to stop the renewal of an ages-old 
                                        crusade that could lay waste to the entire continent and beyond.

                                        For ages warfare has crippled the continent as minor city states, baronies, and principalities fought in an endless round of hostilities. 
                                        Only the alliance of the rival Tali and Quon cities could field the resources to mount a hegemony from coast to coast -- and thus become 
                                        known as Quon Tali.

                                        <br><br>It is a generation since the collapse of this dynasty and regional powers are once more rousing themselves. Into this arena of 
                                        renewed border wars come two youths to the powerful central city state that is Li Heng. One is named Dorin, and he comes determined 
                                        to prove himself the most skilled assassin of his age; he is chasing the other youth -- a Dal Hon mage who has proven himself 
                                        annoyingly difficult to kill.
                                        
                                        <br><br>Li Heng has been guided and warded for centuries by the powerful sorceress known as the "Protectress", and she allows no rivals. 
                                        She and her cabal of five mage servants were enough to repel the Quon Tali Iron Legions -- what could two youths hope to accomplish under 
                                        their stifling rule?
                                        
                                        <br><br>Yet under the new and ambitious King Chulalorn the Third, Itko Kan is on the march from the south. 
                                        He sends his own assassin servants, the Nightblades, against the city, and there are hints that he also commands inhuman forces out of legend.
                                        
                                        <br><br>While above all, shadows swirl oddly about Li Heng, and monstrous slathering beasts seem to appear from nowhere to run howling 
                                        through the street. It is a time of chaos and upheaval, and in chaos, as the young Dal Hon mage would say, there is opportunity.

                                        After the disappointments of Li Heng, Dancer and Kellanved wash up on a small insignificant island named Malaz. 
                                        Immediately, of course, Kellanved plans to take it over. To do so they join forces with a small band of Napans who have fled a civil war on 
                                        their own home island. 
                                        
                                        <br><br>The plan, however, soon goes awry as Kellanved develops a strange and dangerous fascination for a mysterious ancient structure 
                                        found on the island.
                                        
                                        <br><br>The chaos in the region extends to the metaphysical planes also as a young priest of D'rek starts to question the rot at the 
                                        heart of the worship of the god of decay. And back in Li Heng, Dassem, now the proclaimed Sword of Hood, finds himself being blamed 
                                        for a plague which leads him to a crisis of faith - and searching for answers.
                                        
                                        <br><br>During all this, war with the neighbouring island of Nap threatens, recruited allies wonder at Kellanvedâ€™s sanity, and powerful entities take more of an interest in the little mage from Dal Hon. Dancer faces a hard choice: should he give up on his partnership? Especially when the fellowâ€™s obsession with shadows and ancient artefacts brings the both of them alarmingly close to death and destruction.
                                        <br>After all, who in his right mind would actually wish to enter an Elder mystery known to everyone as the 'Deadhouse'?

                                        The incessant war between the bickering city states of Quon Tali rages. So engrossed are the warring lords and princes in their own 
                                        petty feuds that few notice that an upstart mage from Dal Hon has gained control of the southern seas.

                                        <br><br>Kellanved could not care less about any of this petty politicking or strategy or war. Something other and altogether more 
                                        mysterious has caught his attention and he - together with a reluctant and his decidedly skeptical friend Dancer - 
                                        traverse continents and journey through the Realms. 
                                        
                                        <br><br>But this ancient mystery that has so captivated Kellanved is neither esoteric nor ephemeral. It involves the Elder races 
                                        themselves, and more alarmingly, the semi-mythic Army of Dust and Bone.
                                        
                                        <br><br>Surely no one in their right mind would be so foolish as to embark on a journey from which none have returned? 
                                        <br>Well, no one except Kellanved.

                                        It is a bitter winter and civil war now ravages Kurald Galain, as Urusander's Legion prepares to march upon the city of Kharkanas.
                                        The rebels' only opposition lies scattered, bereft of a leader since Anomander's departure in search of his estranged brother, Andarist. 
                                        The last brother remaining, Silchas Ruin, rules in Anomander's stead. He seeks to gather the Houseblades of the Highborn Noble families 
                                        and resurrect the Hust Legion in the southlands, but is fast running out of time.

                                        <br><br>The officers and leaders of Urusander's Legion, led by Hunn Raal, want the Consort, Draconus, cast aside and Vatha Urusander 
                                        wedded to Mother Dark, taking his place on a throne at the side of the Living Goddess. But this union will be far more than political, as a 
                                        sorcerous power has claimed those opposing Mother Dark - given form by the exiled High Priestess Syntara, the Cult of Light rises in 
                                        answer to Mother Dark and her Children.                                        
                                                   
                                        <br><br>Far to the west, an unlikely army has gathered, seeking an enemy without form, in a place none can find, and commanded by a 
                                        Jaghut driven mad with grief. Hood's call has been heard, and the long-abandoned city of Omtose Phellack is now home to a rabble of 
                                        new arrivals. 
                                        
                                        <br><br>From the south have come Dog-Runners and Jheck warriors. From the Western Sea strange ships have grounded upon the harsh shore, 
                                        with blue-skinned strangers arriving to offer Hood their swords. And from the North, down from mountain fastnesses and isolated valleys, 
                                        Toblakai arrive, day and night, to pledge themselves to Hood's impossible war. Soon, all will set forth - or not at all - under the banners 
                                        of the living. Soon, weapons will be drawn, with Death itself the enemy.
                                              
                                        <br><br>Beneath the chaos of such events, and spanning the realm and those countless other realms hidden behind its veil, magic now bleeds 
                                        into the world. Unconstrained, mysterious and savage, the power that is the lifeblood of the Azathanai, K'rul, runs loose and wild. 
                                        Following its scent, seeking the places of wounding where the sorcery rushes forth, entities both new and ancient are gathering. 
                                        And they are eager to feed.
                                        
                                        <br><br>Comprehending the terrible risk of his gift of blood, a weakened, dying K'rul sets out, in the company of a lone guardian, 
                                        to bring order to this newborn sorcery - alas, his choice of potential allies is suspect. In the name of order, K'rul seeks its greatest 
                                        avowed enemy.

                                        Many years have passed since three Teblor warriors brought carnage and chaos to the small lakeside settlement of Silver Lake. 
                                        <br>While the town has recovered, the legacy of that past horror remains, even if the Teblor tribes of the north no longer venture into 
                                        the southlands. 
                                        
                                        <br><br>One of those three, Karsa Orlong, is now deemed to be a god, albeit an indifferent one. In truth, many new cults and religions 
                                        have emerged across the Malazan world, including those who worship Coltaine, the Black-Winged God, and - popular among the Empire's soldiery - 
                                        followers of the cult of Iskar Jarak, Guardian of the Dead.

                                        <br><br>A legion of Malazan marines is on the march towards Silver Lake. responding to intelligence that indicates the tribes beyond the 
                                        border are stirring. The marines aren't quite sure what they're going to be facing but, while the Malazan military has evolved and 
                                        these are not the marines of old, one thing hasn't changed: they'll handle whatever comes at them. Or die trying
                                        
                                        <br><br>Meanwhile, in the high mountains, where dwell the tribes of the Teblor, a new warleader has risen. Scarred by the deeds of Karsa 
                                        Orlong, he intends to confront his god, even if he has to cut a bloody path through the Malazan Empire to do it. 
                                        
                                        <br><br>Higher in the mountains, a new threat has emerged, and now the Teblor are running out of time.
                                        The long feared invasion is about to begin. And this time it won't be three simple warriors. This time thousands are 
                                        poised to flood the lands of the south. And in their way, a single legion of Malazan marines . . .
                                        
                                        <br><br>It seems the past is about to revisit Silver Lake, and that is never a good thing . . .

                                        <br>A sinister, diabolical killer stalks the port city's narrow, barrow-humped streets, and panic grips the citizens like a fever. 
                                        
                                        <br><br>Emancipor Reese is no exception, and indeed, with his legendary ill luck, it's worse for him than for most. 
                                        Not only was his previous employer the unknown killer's latest victim, but Emancipor is out of work. And, with his dearest wife

                                        for her and their two whelps -- all other terrors grow limp and pale for poor Emancipor. But perhaps his luck has finally changed,

                                        requesting the services of a manservant. This is surely a remarkable opportunity for the hapless Emancipor Reese... 
                                        no matter that the note reeks with death-warded magic; no matter that the barrow ghosts themselves howl with fear every night; 
                                        and certainly no matter that Lamentable Moll itself is about to erupt in a frenzy of terror-inspired anarchy....

                                        <br>So well, in fact, that something has to be done. 
                                        
                                        <br><br>The zeal for goodness can be catastrophic, and no-one knows this better than Bauchelain and Korbal Broach, 
                                        two stalwart champions of all things bad. For the innumerable citizens of Quaint, driven to neurotic distraction and overwhelmed with good 
                                        living, desperation breeds nefarious bed-mates, and before long the two homicidal necromancers â€” and their beleaguered and 
                                        substance-addled manservant, Emancipor Reese â€” find themselves ensnared in a scheme to bring goodness into disrepute, if not utter ruination. 
                                        
                                        <br><br>To Reese's bemusement, laudable motivations are, in a bizarre twist, uncharacteristically relevant to Master Bauchelain, 
                                        although, of course, the payment of a chest filled with gold helps. Even so, sometimes, it turns out, one must bring down civilization... 
                                        in the name of civilization.

                                        In the wake of their blissful sojourn in the city of Lamentable Moll, the intrepid sorcerors Bauchelain and Korbal Broach â€” 
                                        along with their newly hired manservant, Emancipor Reese â€” have set out on the wide open seas aboard the sturdy Suncurl.

                                        <br><br>Alas, thereâ€™s more baggage in the hold than meets the beady eyes of Suncurlâ€™s hapless crew, and once on the cursed sea-lane 
                                        known as Laughterâ€™s End â€” the Red Road in which flows the blood of an Elder God â€” unseemly terrors are prodded awake, to the 
                                        understated dismay of all.
                                        
                                        <br><br>It is said that it is not the destination that counts, but the journey itself. Such a noble, worthy sentiment. 
                                        Aye, it is the journey that counts, especially when what counts is horror, murder, mischance and mayhem. 
                                        
                                        <br><br>For Bauchelain, Korbal Broach and Emancipor Reese, it is of course just one more night on the high seas, on a journey without 
                                        end â€” and that counts for a lot

                                        It is an undeniable truth: give evil a name and everyoneâ€™s happy.  
                                        <br>Give it two names andâ€¦why, theyâ€™re even happier.

                                        <br><br>Intrepid necromancers Bauchelain and Korbal Broach, scourges of civilization, raisers of the dead, reapers of the souls 
                                        of the living, devourers of hope, betrayers of faith, slayers of the innocent, and modest personifications of evil, 
                                        have a lot to answer for and answer they will. 
                                        <br>Known as the Nehemoth, they are pursued by countless self-professed defenders of decency, sanity, and civilization. 
                                        After all, since when does evil thrive unchallenged? Well, oftenâ€”but not this time.
                                        
                                        <br><br>Hot on their heels are the Nehemothanai, avowed hunters of Bauchelain and Korbal Broach. 
                                        In the company of a gaggle of artists and pilgrims, stalwart Mortal Sword Tulgord Vise, pious Well Knight Arpo Relent, 
                                        stern Huntsman Steck Marynd, and three of the redoubtable Chanter brothers (and their lone sister) 
                                        find themselves faced with the cruelest of choices. The legendary Crackâ€™d Pot Trail, a stretch of harsh 
                                        wasteland between the Gates of Nowhere and the Shrine of the Indifferent God, has become a tortured path of deprivation.
                                        
                                        <br><br>Will honor, moral probity, and virtue prove champions in the face of brutal necessity? 
                                        <br>No, of course not. Donâ€™t be silly.

                                        Tyranny comes in many guises, and tyrants thrive in palaces and one-room hovels, in back alleys and playgrounds. 
                                        
                                        <br><br>Tyrants abound on the verges of civilization, where disorder frays the rule of civil conduct and propriety surrenders to 
                                        brutal imposition. Millions are made to kneel and yet more millions die horrible deaths in a welter of suffering and misery.

                                        <br><br>But leave all that behind and plunge into escapist fantasy of the most irrelevant kind, and in the ragged wake of the tale 
                                        told in Lees of Laughter's End, those most civil adventurers, Bauchelain and Korbal Broach, along with their suitably phlegmatic 
                                        manservant, Emancipor Reese, make gentle landing upon a peaceful beach, beneath a quaint village at the foot of a majestic castle. 
                                        There they make acquaintance with the soft-hearted and generous folk of Spendrugle, which lies at the mouth of the Blear River 
                                        and falls under the benign rule of the Lord of Wurms in his lovely keep.
                                        
                                        <br><br>Make welcome, then, to Spendrugle's memorable residents, including the man who should have stayed dead, the woman 
                                        whose prayers should never have been answered, the tax collector everyone ignores, the ex-husband town militiaman who never 
                                        married, the beachcomber who lives in his own beard, the now singular lizard cat who used to be plural, and the girl who likes to 
                                        pee in your lap. 
                                        <br>And of course, hovering over all, the denizen of the castle keep, Lord--Ah, but there lies this tale.
