## UX

### Business Goals
My goal as a website owner is to gain **high traction** and reach as many users in high-fantasy book community, thus showing my support to both authors of these wonderful books. 

### User Stories

* I want to find information about the author of the book
* I want to be reminded of the events in the book
#### Returning visitor

* I want to find information about relationships between books

* I want to find interesting quotes from the books

### Design
The website consists of 5 pages total, all 5 rich with content and links. It's responsive and users will be able to access it through number of devices, starting from small-frame mobile devices, on to tablets, laptops and even small sized TV.

#### Wireframes
Wireframes are separated by the Web Pages, offering device by device view of each page.

Note: during the development of the website small changes were implemented so the website may differ from original wireframes.

## Testing
### Automated Testing
### Manual Testing
### Bugs
* Hamburger collapse show: Items would not align to the right side of a browser.
    * Tried placing mr-auto, justify-content-end, many kind of item and text alignments to get them to move at least a bit ~ no success 
    * FIX: Added display property to div that consists of nav-items which collapse from hamburger menu. Value was "block" and it has been changed to "flex". After that I added ml-auto class to HTML "ul" tag and it aligned to right side of browser window nicely.
